This project aims to detect depression from EEG signals using Convolutional Neural Networks, specifically the DenseNet architecture.  
Executed entirely on Google Colab.

## 🧠 Key Features
- Raw EEG signal preprocessing (filtering, normalization)
- CNN-based model (DenseNet)
- Trained and evaluated with visual metrics

## 📁 Files
- `EEG_Depression_Detection.ipynb`: Main project notebook
- (Include any other files if you upload them later)

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Python
- Google Colab
- TensorFlow / Keras
- EEG dataset (source)
## 📌 Note
This project is part of a mini-project review for automated depression detection.
